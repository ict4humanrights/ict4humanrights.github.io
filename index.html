        <h2>WebMirror</h2>
        <h3>What is the WebMirror?</h3>
<p>It is a lightweight linux application capable of periodically retrieving the content of a website under threats (censorship, hacking) and in the event of the unavailability of the website, able to host static mirrors using resilient cloud or other infrastructure.</p>
<p>Easy to install and configure, with a small memory footprint, it can run in the background of an old spare Linux-based PC or on a dedicated server; as long as there is a connection to the Internet, the tool can retrieve the content of the website and distribute it through its web-server.</p>
<p>The application is packaged with the mirroring tools and a pre-configured, lightweight, and SSL-compatible web server (nginx).  Administrators will, in an intuitive fashion via command line, be able to provide the URLs of targeted websites, specify mirroring criteria and intervals, and automatically begin hosting a mirror if a given website is found to be unavailable. It can also be configured to automatically send an email to a specific address, or to post a URL to a determined Facebook page once the website is down to continue distribute the blocked content.</p>

<p>TO DO</p>

<h3>List of features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Threaded, parallel mirroring, allowing the user to simultaneously mirror as many websites as his/her computer’s processing power will allow.</li>
  <li>Direct integration with the web server package nginx, which is ideal for serving high-volume static web sites.</li>
  <li>Independent routine for monitoring the uptime of censored/targeted servers, which regularly checks accessibility for the target sites.</li>
  <li>Automated posting of mirror URL to Facebook profile or via email alerts.</li>
  <li>User-configurable delay between requests for content from the mirrored site, to keep server load manageable.</li>
  <li>All web mirroring platform traffic is disguised as traffic coming from a regular web browser, to ensure that the web servers fulfill requests for content as they would for regular users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What is the NewsObfuscator?</h3>
<p>It is lightweight linux application that can aggregate and deliver content such as online news headlines, politically sensitive information or any other feed-based message within citizen movements using small and secure image files, whose content cannot be easily read by SMS message or web content filtering technologies.</p>
<p>Once installed and configured on a Linux based PC, it will automatically and at a customizable time interval, gather headlines from selected RSS feeds and output them as a series of lightweight GIF images.</p>
<p>The images can be automatically posted on a Facebook page or by email, to be then redistributed by the prefered channel of the citizen movement, such as MMS messaging, but also via social networks (Facebook, twitter, etc...).</p>
<p>The system is highly responsive to issues of security and reliability:  every image is assigned a unique random name and file size. Levels of random noise to frustrate automated optical character recognition systems are imposed on every picture.</p>
<p>The application is packaged with a lightweight web server (nginx) capable of securely hosting the generated images while using a minimal memory footprint. This makes it easy to run in the background of a desktop PC but also of an old spare Linux based machine as long as it is connected to the Internet.</p>
